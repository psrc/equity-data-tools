## Planning for Equity at PSRC{.slide_body_text_sm}
<div style="position:absolute; top:5%; left:5%;">
<slideheadstyle>Planning for Equity at PSRC</slideheadstyle>
</div>

The central Puget Sound region has a long history of racism that continues to cause enormous harm. Generations of discrimination, disinvestment, and inequitable opportunities have helped lay the groundwork for a region where people of color and white residents too often have completely different experiences. As a planning agency, PSRC makes decisions that shape transportation, land use, and the built environment. The agency has a responsibility to dismantle systems of inequity and re-imagine a region where race can no longer predict life outcomes.

PSRC is developing a Regional Equity Strategy to improve outcomes for marginalized communities and how the agency operates internally. The agency will lead with race, which has proven to be an effective method for not only increasing equitable outcomes for people of color but developing a framework, tools, and resources that can remove barriers for other marginalized groups. The Regional Equity Strategy will provide guidance to help members work in a coordinated manner towards the region's goal of providing an exceptional quality of life and opportunity for all. It will also provide guidance and training for staff to ensure the agency effectively uses its roles to advance racial equity.  

The work plan is anticipated to be finalized in spring 2021, for the next budget and work program. Initial phases of the strategy will be finalized in 2022. This work will be ongoing and the current draft timeline is:

## Data for Equity at PSRC{.slide_body_text_sm}
<div style="position:absolute; top:5%; left:5%;">
<slideheadstyle>PSRC Data and Analysis to Promote Racial Equity</slideheadstyle>
</div>

As the federally designated metropolitan planning organization for our region and the state-designated regional transportation planning organization, PSRC is responsible for developing and regularly updating the region’s long-range transportation plan as well as distributing federal transportation funds to local projects through its transportation improvement program. In 2003, PSRC developed a baseline demographic profile as an initial step toward better integrating environmental justice into its transportation work program. That profile is updated every couple of years to present current demographic data describing the central Puget Sound region to identify population groups and communities to be considered for subsequent environmental justice analyses and activities. We consider the Demographic Profile an important work item for our Data Department but as a staff, we are fully committed to doing more to advance Racial Equity in our region through enhanced data analysis and data sharing.

The set of data provided here is the beginning of a commitment to further the understanding of racial inequities across our region through the use of data. Some of the data here might come as a surprise to some and to others it might be a no-brainer but we are providing it to ensure that we are all starting from the same level of knowledge about the racial inequities of our region that we all love.

After looking at this information, please feel free to share with anyone who might be interested and if you have further ideas of data to dig into to, please contact us.

The central Puget Sound region continues to grow and the share of people of color continues to increase. In `r yr`, people of color accounted for approximately `r toString(round(region.non.white*100, 0))`% of the region’s total population.

Although the region continues to diversify, the central Puget Sound region continues to be one of the less-diverse metropolitan regions across the country. Of the `r msa.nonwhite.count` metropolitan areas with 1 million people or more across the nation, the central Puget Sound region ranks `r psrc.msa.nonwhite.rank` in terms of the percentage of people of color.

Population distributions differ across the region's four counties.

In contrast, Black/African American people comprised `r toString(round(kitsap.black*100, 1))`% of Kitsap County's total population and non-White persons comprised `r toString(round(kitsap.non.white*100, 1))`%.

Education is a key foundation for future career earnings. The Central Puget Sound is known as one of the most highly educated metropolitan regions in the nation. In `r yr`, approximately `r toString(round(region.edu.all*100, 0))`% of all residents had at least a Bachelor's Degree however the share of people with degrees varies across race.

Educational disparities are even greater when you look by county. `r toString(round(king.edu.all*100,0))`% of all King County residents have a college degree but only `r toString(round(king.edu.black*100, 0))`% of Black/African American residents do (`r toString(round((1-(king.edu.black/king.edu.all))*100, 0))`% less than the population as a whole). These disparities make it even more challenging to afford to live in our most populous county.
